## Pre-requisites

* [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog) > 0.10.0

## Usage

To recommended way is to integrate with Godog and Go test as specified in the [Godog documentation](https://github.com/cucumber/godog#running-godog-with-go-test)

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"os"
	"testing"

	apicontext "github.com/brpaz/godog-api-context"
	"github.com/cucumber/godog"
)

var opts = godog.Options{
	Format:        "progress", // can define default values,
}

func init() {
	godog.BindFlags("godog.", flag.CommandLine, &opts)
}

func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	flag.Parse()
	opts.Paths = flag.Args()

	apiContext := apicontext.New("<base_url>")

	status := godog.TestSuite{
		Name:                "godogs",
		ScenarioInitializer: apiContext.InitializeScenario,
		Options:             &opts,
	}.Run()

	if st := m.Run(); st > status {
		status = st
	}
	os.Exit(status)
}
```

You can see a complete example together with Feature files in [examples folder](examples).

## Available step definitions

`^I set query param "([^"]*)" with value "([^"]*)"$`

`^I set query params to:$`

`^I set header "([^"]*)" with value "([^"]*)"$`

`^I set headers to:$`

`^I send "([^"]*)" request to "([^"]*)" with form body::$`

`^I send "([^"]*)" request to "([^"]*)"$`

`^I send "([^"]*)" request to "([^"]*)" with body:$`

`^The response code should be (\d+)$`

`^The response should be a valid json$`

`^The response should match json:$`

`The response header "([^"]*)" should have value ([^"]*)$`

`^The response should match json schema "([^"]*)"$`

`^The json path "([^"]*)" should have value "([^"]*)"$`

`^wait for  (\d+) seconds$`

`^Store data in scope variable "([^"]*)" with value ([^"]*)`

`^I store the value of response header "([^"]*)" as ([^"]*) in scenario scope$`

`^I store the value of body path "([^"]*)" as "([^"]*)" in scenario scope$`

`^The scenario variable "([^"]*)" should have value "([^"]*)"$`


## Scope Values

This can also store the values from http response body and header and then use in subsequent requests. 
To use the value of scope variable, use this ``pattern: `##(keyname)` without parenthesis``

Example:
```
I store the value of response header "X-AUTH-TOKEN" as token in scenario scope
I set header "X-AUTH-TOKEN" with value "`##token`"
```

This can be used for Authentication headers.

## TODO

* Add steps for setting Cookies
